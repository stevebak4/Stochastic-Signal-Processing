Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis and simulation of stochastic signals in wireless communication systems using MATLAB™. The project consists of five tasks that require deriving mathematical expressions and implementing MATLAB™ scripts to verify theoretical results through simulations. The tasks cover concepts such as probability density functions, channel capacity, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in fading environments.

Tasks Breakdown

Task 1: Probability Density Function (PDF) of |h|²

    Derive the closed-form mathematical expression for the probability density function of the 
    squared magnitude of the complex random variable hh.Plot the PDF for σ2=0.5σ2=0.5 
    and m=2.5m=2.5 in MATLAB™.

Task 2: Empirical PDF of |h|²

    Generate 106106 samples of ∣h∣2∣h∣2 for σ2=0.5σ2=0.5 and m=2.5m=2.5 in MATLAB™.
    Plot the empirical PDF and compare it with the analytical result from Task 1.

Task 3: PDF of |h|

    Derive the closed-form expression for the PDF of ∣h∣∣h∣.
    Verify the result for σ2=0.5σ2=0.5 and m=2.5m=2.5 by comparing the analytical and empirical PDFs in MATLAB™.
    Identify the known distribution that arises when m=1m=1.

Task 4: SNR in a Flat Fading Wireless System

    Consider the model y=hx+wy=hx+w for a flat-fading wireless communication system.
    Derive the PDF of the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a given average SNR.

Task 5: Channel Capacity in Fading Channels

    Using the result from Task 4 with m=1m=1, implement and plot the average channel 
    capacity for SNR values from -5 dB to 20 dB.

Instructions

    The project is individual and mandatory. The deadline for submission is Friday, April 15, 2022.
    Your submission should include:
        A report with detailed answers to each task, containing both theoretical derivations and MATLAB™ plots.
        The MATLAB™ scripts with sufficient comments for readability.
    Note: Instead of MATLAB™, you may use Python after consulting with the instructor.

Tools Used

    LaTeX for report writing.
    MATLAB™ for simulations and plotting.
